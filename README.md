## Description
ideal-funicular is a simple note-taking application built using Express.js. It allows small business owners or anyone to write, save, and organize their notes effectively. With this application, you can easily keep track of tasks, jot down thoughts, and manage your notes efficiently.

## User Story
As a small business owner, I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
- When you open the Note Taker, you are presented with a landing page that includes a link to a notes page.
- Clicking on the link to the notes page takes you to a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column and empty fields to enter a new note title and note text in the right-hand column.
- After entering a new note title and note text, "Save Note" and "Clear Form" buttons appear in the navigation at the top of the page.
- Clicking the "Save Note" button saves the new note and adds it to the list of existing notes in the left-hand column, and the navigation buttons disappear.
- Clicking on an existing note in the list on the left displays that note in the right-hand column, and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation.
- Clicking the "New Note" button presents you with empty fields to enter a new note title and note text in the right-hand column, and the button disappears.
